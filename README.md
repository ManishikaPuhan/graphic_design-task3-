Business Card Design Overview
Design Concept: The business card design aims to present a clean and modern look, suitable for a professional individual, such as a web developer. It emphasizes clarity and organization, making key information easy to find.

Structure:

Header:

Displays the individual's name prominently, using a larger font size to draw attention.
The job title is positioned directly beneath the name, slightly smaller but still noticeable, reinforcing the individual's professional identity.
Body:

Contains essential contact information: email, phone number, and website.
The text is concise and neatly arranged, ensuring readability while maintaining a professional appearance.
Footer:

Features the company name and a tagline, reinforcing branding.
The footer text is smaller, subtly placed to not distract from the main contact details.
Color Scheme:

A minimalist palette is used, with a white background that creates a fresh and professional feel.
Text colors vary in intensity, using darker shades for names and titles, and lighter shades for contact information, providing a clear hierarchy.
Typography:

A sans-serif font is used throughout for a modern, clean look.
Different font sizes help distinguish between various pieces of information, making it easy for viewers to navigate.
Layout:

The card is well-structured with a balanced layout, ensuring that all elements are aligned and spaced appropriately.
Rounded corners and a subtle box shadow give the card a slight elevation, adding a contemporary touch.
